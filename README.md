# Habitica-Outlook
Some codes to make To Dos and Flagged items in Outlook count as To Dos in Habitica.

This codes are used to make an integration between Outlook (the Office app) into Habitica. It may use both flagged messages and tasks.

I'm not a programmer, just a curious person that really wanted to make it work, so you may find inconsistencies, errors or just a hard-to-read code. Nevertheless, Feel free to ask anything.

PS: Some images have things written in Portuguese because I'm from Brazil. But I made sure that all code are in English.
